      <p>The most interesting thing about me is that I am very passionate with the tech field, and one day I want contirbute to something new that will change the world. I am also a slow learner, it takes me a quite of bit of time to learn something. I also love to cut hair and I cut most of my friends hair here at OSU. The most unique experience I had this year was going to Hawai, the vibe was completely different there and i miss it.</p>
